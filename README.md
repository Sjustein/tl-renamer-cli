# tl-renamer-cli
Timelapserenamer is a very simple program that should have been written as a bash or batch script.
It sorts every file in a specified directory on time created, no matter what type of file. It is meant to generate files in an image sequence for processing the images into a timelapse more easily.
At the moment, it just copies all the files into a folder called 'Converted', but it will be elaborated on.
It will eventually be part of the timelapse manager desktop: https://github.com/Sjustein/tl-manager-desktop
